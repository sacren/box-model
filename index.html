    <p>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</p>
    <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.</p>
    <p>His house is in the village though;</p>
    <p>He will not see me stopping here</p>
    <p>To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>
    <p>My little horse must think it queer</p>
    <p>To stop without a farmhouse near</p>
    <p>Between the woods and frozen lake</p>
    <p>The darkest evening of the year.</p>
    <p>He gives his harness bells a shake</p>
    <p>To ask if there is some mistake.</p>
    <p>The only other soundâ€™s the sweep</p>
    <p>Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
    <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</p>
    <p>But I have promises to keep,</p>
    <p>And miles to go before I sleep,</p>
